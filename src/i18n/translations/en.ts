        description: "This is my baby, Talita. She's 7 years old (Feb 2). She's a very sweet and loving cat, but only at a distance. She loves to play and sleep. <br><br>Like most cats she's very curious and loves to explore, you cannot leave a single bag or box anywhere in the house that she will scratch, bite and open it. She hates being picked up when she doesnt want to and cries when feels alone. She's very special to me."

        description: "I'm from Algarve, the southernmost region of Portugal. I also have a dog (a yorkie) who's 17 years old! (Yes, that's crazy!). My hometown is Silves, a small city with a lot of history. It used to be the capital of Algarve and it's known for its castle and the medieval fair that happens every year. However, I myself have a house in the country side, next to Guia, the birthplace of the famous chicken piri-piri."

        title: "Likes",
        description: "I have a lot of interests, from science to politics to planes. However, my most favourite things to do are, by far, playing video games with friends and watching series (mostly anime, but I watch almost anything). Always open to suggestions of new games and series to watch, so don't be shy. <br><br>Warframe was definitely the game that I've invested the most into. I've been playing it since 2013/2014 (when it was in beta) and I have over 2000 hours in it. I ran a big alliance of over 1000 players for a while and used to host events with prizes. <br> <br> I've played a lot of minecraft over the years and still run 1 public modded server. Again if you want to join tell me and I'll gladly add you or boot up server for us to play."

I got my masters in software engineering from the University of Coimbra.<br><br> Besides work and my hobbies I spent my saturdays studying to become a pilot (Private Pilot License) in the Aeroclube de Coimbra. Tech-wise I dabble in a lot of things and like to learn new technologies. <br><br> Currently I make/maintain mods for games, namely Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Stardew Valley (You can check them out on my github in the section below or at Nexus mods website, my name is 6135)"
